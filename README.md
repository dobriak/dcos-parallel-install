# Install DC/OS in parallel

This repository contains complementary code to my [blog post](https://dobriak.github.io/post/automated-advanced-dcos-installation/) on automating the advanced installation of DC/OS.

In a nutshell: read the article, spin up your instances on AWS, fill the cluster.conf file with IP addresses, run dcos-parallel-install.sh. You will get a working DC/OS cluster version 1.8.8 in about 15 minutes.

PRs and Issues welcome.
